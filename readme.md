# Alzheimer's Disease detection using HOG and SVM

Brain **MRI** contains information about the brains state and behaviour, by using this we can easily detect the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Using machine learning (ML) we can create a model that can classify the brain MRI as per the severity. 
### Datasets used in this code have four classes they are : 
- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented

![Brain MRI indicating severity of AD. Top row images from left: Mild Demented, Moderate demented. Bottom row from left Very Mild Demented, Non Demented](https://github.com/spearpx/Alzheimer-s-Disease-detection-using-HOG-and-SVM-/blob/main/brainMRIclasses.jpg?raw=true)

The image gives the brain MRI from each class. From the image it can be seen that the ventricles of brain start to increase in size as the severity of AD increases.
