# Alzheimer's Disease detection using HOG and SVM

Brain **MRI** contains information about the brains state and behaviour, by using this we can easily detect the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Using machine learning (ML) we can create a model that can classify the brain MRI as per the severity. 
### Datasets used in this code have four classes they are : 
- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
